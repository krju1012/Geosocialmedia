\section{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item To which exent are flood intensities predictable with help of Social-Media messages? 
\item To which extent can training methods improve the accuracy of predicted floods?
\item Is the theoretical approach of Social-Media based flood prediction feasible to realise in practice? 
\item Which factors does a region need to be best suited for flood prediction with AGI?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relevance of Research Questions}
Relevanz der Forschung --> current issues:  (Wen interessiert es? Warum? Welchen Beitrag zur Gesellschaft leistet die Arbeit?)

Most common disaster globally (2006-2014)
- Water level measurements not evenly distributed
- Regions differ in infrastructural standards
- Big differences between countries or even within states

Aim of Research proposal:
- Create method to model distributions of Flickr messages
- Flood related tags
- Major goal:
- Model floods solely based on Flickr (in practice just extension to existing flood 
prediction models)
- Area of interest
	- High rate of flood-related impacts
	- Low quality/quantity water level measuring infrastructure
	- High level social-media usage rate
	
\subsection{Literatural context}
(Literatur als theoretische, empirische Basis; Hypothesen sollten sich aus Literatur ergeben)
