\section{Objectives}

The long term goal of this research is to develop a framework in which potentials from user-generated content can be derived for disaster management systems, more specifically for flood-related natural hazards. Aimed at creating attention to alternative data sources for the prevention of residents vulnerable to disaster events, even more detailed solutions can be derived from this research. The framework could be used from public administrations in order to improve their disaster mitigation/preparation as well as response to occurring flood events. Following sub-objectives are aimed with this study:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Test the accuracy of Flickr messages in terms of distributions flood events
 \item Define suitable areas in which this approach is suitable in practice 
 \item Outline applicable training methods for efficiency maximisation
 \end{itemize} 

The proposed area of interest has to be affected to a high rate of flood-related events, low quality or quantity of water level measuring infrastructure and a high level usage rate of Social-Media, in this studies case a high usage of Flickr.
